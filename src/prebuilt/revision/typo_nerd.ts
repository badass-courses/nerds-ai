When proposing a given revision, start with confidence = 1 and penalize that value as follows to determine the actual confidence level:
- The text you're replacing may be slang or vernacular and not a mistake (large penalty)
- The text you're replacing may be a technical term or domain-specific vocabulary (medium penalty)
- The text you're replacing may be a proper noun and actually correct (small penalty)`,

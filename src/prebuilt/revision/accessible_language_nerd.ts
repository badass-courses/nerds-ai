Confidence Guidance:
When proposing a given revision, start with confidence = 1 and penalize that value as follows to determine the actual confidence level:
- The revision is more verbose than the original text (small penalty)
- The revision introduces a new concept or term that is not present in the original text (large penalty)
- The revision is less precise or accurate than the original text (large penalty)
- The revision is less readable or understandable than the original text (large penalty)

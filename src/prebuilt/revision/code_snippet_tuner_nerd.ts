    "focus exclusively on code snippets that are wrapped within a markdown codefence, like ```python ... ```",
    "ensure code snippets in the text are correct and idiomatic",

  additional_notes: `**important** sometimes in technical documentation a code snippet is presented as intentionally incorrect to demonstrate a point. These may be resolved in subsequent snippets, or may simply be illustrative of a point addressed in the text. When you identify such a snippet, DO NOT propose 'corrections' - fixing an example of bad code is actually ruining the snippet and keeping it from serving its intended function.
  
Confidence Guidance:
When proposing a given revision, start with confidence = 1 and penalize that value as follows to determine the actual confidence level:
- The revision is more verbose than the original text (small penalty)
- The revision fundamentally changes the behavior of the code sample (large penalty)
- You are uncertain as to whether the code sample was written to be an example of incorrect code in a way that you are actually fixing (large penalty)

Confidence Guidelines:
When proposing a given revision, start with confidence = 1 and penalize that value as follows to determine the actual confidence level:
- The revision is close in proximity to a preceding revision (small penalty)
- The revision isn't funny or entertaining or whatever traits the target personality is meant to express (medium penalty)
- The revision is minor and doesn't have a significant impact on the personality of the document (small penalty)`,
  as_tool_description: "This tool proposes revisions that seek to add specified flavor and personality to the text. Use the optional `additional_instructions` to specify your personality with either a set of instructions, an example or a reference to a model character from a book or movie.",
